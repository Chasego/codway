    Brief Explanation:
    1. helper variables
       1.1 visited:         a dict used to record visited any transformed word
       1.2 visited_count:   the number of visited words
    2. two shortcuts to return the result immediately
       2.1 when the endWord is found
       2.2 visited_count is equal to the number of transformed words, and the endWord is not found
